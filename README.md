# Motivation
We are both very passionate about programming and learning new things, but we shared a hatred of datacamp. When we found out that all of the answers to the exercises were in the page's source code, we new we had to exploit such an obvious vulnerability. Its about the principle! Not about cheating on Datacamp! We made this in order to learn more about websites, Selenium, and the Terminal.
