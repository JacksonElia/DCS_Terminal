# Datacamp Solver Terminal
Datacamp.com has many serious vulnerabilities and this overengineered (and yet still poorly made) pseudo-terminal aims to exploit every single one of them. Its features include but are not limited to:

 - Getting database hints and answers for chapters and modules
 - Full module automation
 - An unnecessarily complex control system that looks a lot smarter than it actually is

It can probably be run on any terminal shell, but will work best on those with *TrueColor* support, such as the MacOS, Linux, or *new* Windows Terminal. 

# Usage
This will be filled out once it is usable!
